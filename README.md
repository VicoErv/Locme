Localize laravel website automatically using **Yandex.Translate**

## Plan :
- Understanding Laravels [Package Development](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/packages) system.
- Create interactive UI using Vue.js and Bootstrap
- Program will be in 2 feature :
    - translate by Model
    - translate by scanning web
- on web scanner, i will
    - save xpath to database
    - take the innerHTML and translate it, so the key is path(URL), and XPath
- on translate by model,
    - translate directly
    - save to translations table (different table with web scanner)
- and localization process is in the front-end, i will think about how its work in back-end next time
- all works must done asynchronously
